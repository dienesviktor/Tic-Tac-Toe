# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

It is a game that is traditionally played by being drawn on paper, and it can be played on a computer or on a variety of media.

This is a relatively simple game usually played on a grid of 3-by-3 squares, but it can be made significantly more complex by increasing the size of the board to 4-by-4, 5-by-5, or even up to a 20-by-20 grid.

### Gameplay
The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid or four in a row in a 4-by-4 grid. 

To start, one player draws a board, creating a grid of squares, usually 3-by-3 or 4-by-4.

In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw.
